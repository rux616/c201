Did you ever wonder what happened to Dick, Jane, and Spot?  As you
might expect, they lived happily ever after.  Jane is a top account
executive for a large brokerage firm.  Dick is a senior engineer for
a major computer vendor.  Spot passed away a few years ago, but he
was happy to the end.  All of his success never altered Spot's
pleasant personality.
